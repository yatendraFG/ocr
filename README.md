# OCR Project

## Overview
This project extracts text from lab reports using OCR techniques in Python. It utilizes YOLOv3 for region detection and Tesseract OCR for text recognition.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv3
- Tesseract OCR
- Google Colab
- OpenCV
- PIL

## Workflow
1. Load and preprocess images
2. Detect regions using YOLOv3
3. Extract text using Tesseract OCR
4. Output structured information

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook `OCR_notebook.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload the required YOLOv3 weights and images.
3. Execute the cells sequentially.
4. The output will contain the extracted text in a structured format.

## Results
The system accurately identifies text regions in lab reports and extracts them for further analysis.
